# 🐱 Welcome to Artificial Purrfection 🎨  

Artificial Purrfection is a responsive website where AI-generated art meets feline charm to create a fictional art portfolio! This project was created by Cecelia Braswell, a web developer with a passion for two things— 🐈 cats and 💻 coding.  

Each piece of art featured here is the result of prompts provided to ChatGPT, generating unique depictions of cats in a variety of artistic styles. From the dreamlike landscapes of 🌌 Surrealism to the bold energy of 🎭 Pop Art, the delicate elegance of 🌿 Art Nouveau, and the expressive brushstrokes of 🖌️ Impressionism, every image showcases how AI can breathe life into creativity.  

Beyond the art itself, Artificial Purrfection is a testament to the power of ⚡ technology and 🎨 imagination. This platform isn’t just a portfolio— it’s a continuous learning journey, where I explore new ways to enhance and grow my web development skills.
